Development of: 
Boardbuilder:
Our initial approach was to make just the manual boardbuilder, in which the user was 
the one making the board and the program only verified for possible interceptions
and if the word actually existed. We achieved this goal with some time left so we decided to create a automatic/random boarduilder.
This board had a different approach because the words were selected at random from the dictionary and as such the 
likelyhood of a possible random interception was really low so we created a Random Word #2 and 
tested if it had any common letters with the main one and if it had, check if adding it to the board is possibe (Interceptions, size etc.)
. All the verifiers remaind the same for the automatic and manual. The Initial position & direction were also randon in the automatic board builder.
We had some trouble in the creation of the automatic boardbuilder because whenever we fixed a problem several others appeared.
 We managed to create a working yet not perfect automatic boardbuilder that we would haved liked to have more time to further improve it
